When you go to the default page, the idea is to make the resource section easy and accessible. I think we have two columns. Imagine that on the left column, which is the sign navigation bar, and on the right side is the report. 

On this navigation bar, you know what that angle looks like, which is one-third or one-fourth of the page. And you have three-fourths of the page that becomes where the content is. On that page, we can give the option of either the person using a grid view with pictures and all that on it or a list view. 

So we should have it at the top right corner of those things to see. This is switch, switch, switch, you know, like a switcher. Now, when you click on each report, it takes you to that report's detail page. 

On that page, you show details about the report, right? The name, the color page and everything, the abstract and all that. They will not have below the link to maybe read online, download, or share. 

We should have the shared resource that we talked about. Share on social media, copy this, share on Twitter, share something. We should have that interface there as well. So it depends on what you click on that document detail page. If you take it to what you're doing below it, it won't be distracting. We can also have related reports. If someone is searching for groundwater in Nigeria, you should also display related reports below that resource. 

Needless to say, we should also have a back button if the person wants to move back to the previous reports
