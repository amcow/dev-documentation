When you go to the default page, the idea is to make the resource section easy and accessible. I think we can have two columns. Imagine that on the left column, which is the sign navigation bar, and on the right side is the report. The navigation bar,  can be one-third or one-fourth of the page. And you have three-fourths of the page that becomes where the content is. 

On that page, we can give the option of either the person using a grid view with pictures and all that on it or a list view. So we should have a switcher it at the top right corner of those things to see

We can a full page with the filters on top as well

When you click on each report, it takes you to that report's detail page. On that page, you show details about the report: the name, the color page and everything, the abstract and all that. There should be a link below to maybe read online, download, or share. 

We should have the share feature that we talked about i.e share on social media, copy this, share on Twitter, share something.   

We can also have related reports. If someone is searching for groundwater in Nigeria, you should also display related reports below that resource. 

Needless to say, we should also have a back button if the person wants to move back to the previous default report page.

!!!primary How will the resource section be updated?
Two primaray ways to update the database: direct upload through the admin panel and partners API integration

The detail approach will be in the admin section of this documentation
