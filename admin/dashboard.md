The main dashboard should allow administrators intuitive navigation and view the summaries of activities happening within the system.

### Navigation

The primary dashboard should offer administrators intuitive navigation through a left-side menu structure, complete with collapsible sub-menus. This design choice maximizes screen real estate, facilitating a broader view for enhanced usability.

### Main Content

The main section of the dashboard provides succinct statistical summaries of vital resources, news updates, and user activities. 

Administrators can easily access a log detailing the latest five user activities, such as logins or report uploads. 

Additionally, strategically placed quick action CTAs streamline common tasks like report uploads or user additions, ensuring optimal functionality without cluttering the user interface.
